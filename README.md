# ACF Slider Block plugin

__Fork it, or download the [latest release](https://github.com/colorful-tones/acf-slider-block/releases), and make it your own!__

This is a demonstration of how you might create a custom [ACF Block](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/blocks/), which is a slider carousel UI. We're using SwiperJS (3rd-party dependency) for the slider JavaScript and CSS (mostly).

## Installation

__Required__ You must have [ACF PRO](https://https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/) installed and activated in order to use the ACF Slider Block plugin.

### Manual

1. Upload the `acf-slider-block` folder to the plugins directory (typically `wp-content/plugins`) in your WordPress installation.
2. Activate the ACF Slider Block plugin.
3. Create a new post or page, and insert the Slider block.
4. That's it.
